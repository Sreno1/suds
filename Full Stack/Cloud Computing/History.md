# History of [[Cloud Computing]]

Time-sharing / #Resource-Pooling goes back to mainframes, where **many terminals** could **share compute power**.

In the 1970s, the Virtual Machine Operating System (OS) mainframes could have multiple virtual systems (VMs) on a single physical node.

VM > guest OS > memory, cpu and drives > shared... but the OS didn't know it

## Virtualization

A huge catalyst for evolutions in communications and computing. #virtualization allowed for **shared hosting environments**, **virtual private servers** and **virtual dedicated servers**.

### #Hypervisor
  : A small software layer that enables multiple operating systems to run alongside eachother, sharing the same physical computing resources. It also logically separates them and provisions resources amongst them, so if one OS suffers a crash, the others do not.
