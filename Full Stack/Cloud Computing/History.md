# History of [[Cloud Computing]]

Time-sharing / #Resource-Pooling goes back to mainframes, where **many terminals** could **share compute power**.

In the 1970s, the Virtual Machine Operating System (OS) mainframes could have multiple virtual systems (VMs) on a single physical node.

VM > guest OS > memory, cpu and drives > shared... but the OS didn't know it

## Virtualization

A huge catalyst for evolutions in communications and computing. #virtualization allowed for **shared hosting environments**, **virtual private servers** and **virtual dedicated servers**.

### [[Hypervisor]]
  : A small software layer that enables multiple operating systems to run alongside eachother, sharing the same physical computing resources.
