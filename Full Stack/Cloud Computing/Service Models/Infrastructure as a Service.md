# IaaS

**Infrastructure as a Service** is a form of cloud-computing that delivers fundamental #compute, #network and #storage resources to consumers #on-demand, over the internet, on a #pay-as-you-go basis.

The cloud provider hosts the infrastructure components traditionally present in an on-premises data center, as well as the virtualization and hyper-v layer.

Customers can create or provision VMs in their choice of region and zone, available from the cloud provider.

These VMs typically come pre-installed with the customer's choice f OS. The customers can then deploy middleware and install apps and run workloads on these VMs. They can also create storage for their workloads and backups. The cloud provider often provides the ability to track and monitor performance and usage, and manage disaster recovery.

## IaaS and the Four Key Components of Cloud Infrastructure

![[Key Components of Cloud Infrastructure]]

1. With IaaS, end users **do not** interact directly with the physical infrastructure, but experience it as a *service provided to them*.
2. IaaS providers manage the hypervisors, and end-users programatically provision virtual instances with desired amounts of compute, memory and storage resources. Typically, this includes #auto-scaling and #load-balancing that provides #scalability and high performance.
3. IaaS is virtualized via virtual desktops or portals accessible via the browser
4. IaaS providers typically offer Object, File and Block storage. Object is the most common mode of storage in the cloud, given that it is highly distributed and resilient.
