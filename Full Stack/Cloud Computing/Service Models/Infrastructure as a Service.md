**Infrastructure as a Service** is a form of cloud-computing that delivers fundamental #compute, #network and #storage resources to consumers #on-demand, over the internet, on a #pay-as-you-go basis.

The cloud provicder hosts the infrtastructure components traditionally present in an on-premesis data center, as well as the virtualization and hyper-v layer.

Customers can create or provision VMs in their choice of region and zone, available from the cloud provider.

These VMs typically come pre-installed with the customer's choice f OS. The customers can then deploy middleware and install apps and run workloads on these VMs. They can also create storage for their workloads and backups. The cloud provieder often provides the abvility to track and monitor performance and usage, and manage disaster recovery.
