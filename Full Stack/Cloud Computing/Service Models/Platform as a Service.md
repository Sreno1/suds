# PaaS

Platform as a Service is a cloud computing model that provides a complete application platform on which to:

- Develop
- Deploy
- Manage
- Run

Applications developed by the client or another third party.

*PaaS providers* host and manage the **installation, configuration, and operation** of **application infrastructure**:

- Servers
- Networks
- Storage
- Operating System
- Application Runtimes
- APIs
- Middleware
- Databases

With PaaS, the *user* manages the **Application Code**.

Generally, PaaS services are paid for on a usage basis, and resources are purchased on-demand.

- High level of abstraction
  - Eliminates complexity of deploying apps
- Support Services and APIs
  - Simplifies development
  - Sometimes integrates things like user auth, workload management, analytics, etc.
- Run-time Environments
  - Executes code according to application owner and cloud provider policies
- Rapid Deployment Mechanisms
  - Deploy, run and scale apps efficiently
- Middleware Capabilities
  - Support a range of infrastructure capabilities
    - App Servers
    - Database Management
    - Rules Engines

## PaaS Use Cases

- API Development and Management
- #IoT
- Business Analytics and Intelligence
- Business Process Management (BPM)
- Master Data Management (MDM)
  - Single point of access for critical business data
  - Transactions
  - Analytics

## Advantages of PaaS

- Scalability
- Faster time to market
