# Cloud Computing

NIST defines cloud computing as  a "model for enabling convenient, #on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal service provider interaction."

## Quotes from Industry Professionals

> "Cloud computing can be descrived as a csuite of API-driven services to manage all aspects of compute networking resources for enterprise computing"
---
> "Virtualized Resources Defined by Software"
---
> Cloud computing could be leveraged for something as small as authentication + logins, think Google or FB auth, or for something as large as hosting projects on cloud-based infrastructure. Other uses include compute power and storage.
---
> Cloud computing abstracts away management of things devs particuluarly don't care to work on.
---
> Small companies can innovate faster using cloud-based high-performance compute clusters

## Essential Characteristics of Cloud Computing

1. \#on-demand #self-service access all day, every day except for an outage or security breach. "Available without Exceptions".
   i.e. 24-hour ATM, vending machine, regardless of holidays, weekends, etc.
2. \#Broad-Network-Access
   - Cloud computing resources can be accessed through the network
   - #Public-cloud services could generally be accessible from anywhere, and on any device with internet and browser capabilities
   - Multitude of devices
   - Internet access is mandatory
     - Or Intranet for #private-cloud, if public access is not necessary
3. \#Resource-Pooling
    - Saves on cost with shared model
      - Affords cloud providers economies of scaled which can be passed down to the consumer
      - #Multi-tenant model serves multiple customers
      - Cloud resources are dynamically assigned and re-aligned
        - Regardless of physical location
4. \#Rapid-Elasticity
    - Increase and decrease resources as-per demand
    - Vertical or Horizontal scaling
    - Add resources during sales or other spikey situations
5. \#Measured-service
   - Pay for what you use, or reserve as you use
     - Not applicable to email servicves, social media sites, and services on a trial basis like AWS, Azure or GCP
   - Utility model of billing, charged after the usage, at the end of each pre-defined period
  
==Deploy code and infrasturcture anywhere, anytime (no waiting - actions taken from portal) and at scale, usually with #elasticity.==

- \#Distribution
- \#Availability
- \#Resiliency
- \#scalability
- Reduced Development Time
- Flexible cost
- Global Scale
